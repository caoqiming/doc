# Neural Radiance Fields

At its core, **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)** is a method that uses a neural network to represent a 3D scene. Instead of building a traditional 3D model with polygons, NeRF's network learns a continuous function that maps any point in 3D space to its color and density.

The process has three main steps:

1.  **Querying the Network**: For a given viewing angle, rays are cast from a virtual camera into the scene. For each ray, the network is queried at multiple points along its path. The input for each query is a point's 3D coordinates ($x, y, z$) and the viewing direction.
2.  **Predicting Color and Density**: The network's output for each point is its **color** and **volume density**. The density indicates how opaque or "solid" that point is.
3.  **Rendering the Image**: Using a technique called volumetric rendering, NeRF integrates the color and density information from all the points along a ray to determine the final color of a single pixel in the output image.

This method allows NeRF to produce highly realistic images with complex light effects, reflections, and transparency, all from a few 2D input photos.

1.  **Does NeRF's output directly produce the final image?**
    No, the neural network's output is not the final image color. Instead, it predicts the **color (RGB)** and **volume density ($\sigma$)** for a specific point in 3D space from a given viewing direction. A separate process called **volumetric rendering** then integrates this information along a ray to calculate the final pixel color.
2.  **How does NeRF know which points to query along a ray?**
    NeRF does not uniformly query all points. To be efficient, it uses a **coarse-to-fine hierarchical sampling** strategy. It first queries a few points uniformly along the ray to identify high-density areas (where objects likely are). It then focuses its computational power by sampling many more points specifically within those high-density regions to capture more detail.

## drawbacks

While NeRFs are excellent for photorealistic rendering, their representation of a scene as a continuous function within a neural network makes them unsuitable for many practical applications that require a structured, editable model.

- Lack of Editability
  The scene's information is "baked" into the neural network's weights, making it a **black box**. To make any change, you typically have to retrain the entire model, which is a slow and computationally expensive process.

- Slow Rendering: While new methods are improving speed, the rendering process for NeRFs is computationally expensive because it involves querying a neural network for every point along every ray, which is less efficient for real-time applications like video games compared to the highly optimized rendering of polygonal meshes.

- Cannot handle non-static scenes.
