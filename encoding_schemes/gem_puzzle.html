    <p>1. First we mark each square on the chessboard with 0 to 63</p>
    <div id="chessboard"></div>
    <p>
      2. Addresses with exactly one bit set to 1 are used as parity check bits
    </p>
    <div id="chessboard-index"></div>
    <p>
      3. If a data bit's address has a 1 in a particular position, it
      participates in that corresponding parity check calculation. The locations
      involved in the parity calculation are marked with corresponding colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first bit of the address of these blocks (from least significant bit
      to most significant bit) is 1
    </p>
    <div id="chessboard-index-0"></div>
    <p>
      The seconds bit of the address of these blocks (from least significant bit
      to most significant bit) is 1
    </p>
    <div id="chessboard-index-1"></div>
    <p>
      The third bit of the address of these blocks (from least significant bit
      to most significant bit) is 1
    </p>
    <div id="chessboard-index-2"></div>
    <p>
      The fourth bit of the address of these blocks (from least significant bit
      to most significant bit) is 1
    </p>
    <div id="chessboard-index-3"></div>
    <p>
      The fifth bit of the address of these blocks (from least significant bit
      to most significant bit) is 1
    </p>
    <div id="chessboard-index-4"></div>
    <p>
      The sixth bit of the address of these blocks (from least significant bit
      to most significant bit) is 1
    </p>
    <div id="chessboard-index-5"></div>
    <p>
      4. Next, we just need to calculate the parity of the above 6 areas to get
      6 bits. Note that the order of these 6 bits needs to be arranged from low
      to high in the order mentioned above. We can think of it as an address
      pointing to a certain square. If you want to make this address point to
      the gem by flipping the chess piece, you just need to XOR the address of
      the gem with the current address, and flip the result to the chess piece
      corresponding to the address.
    </p>

      If you think the 8*8 chessboard is too big, you can also try the 4*4
      chessboard.
