## fiend, neighbour

He is a very helpful neighbour because I can always see him reach out to thouse in need.

These qualities already make him a good neighbor, but I would say he is also a compassionate person. Whenever he sees cyberbullying or online harassment, he chooses to standup leaving a compassionate comment. He said, even one comment can make a difference. I really admire his courage because I have to confess that I'm not as brave as him.I don't have the courage to leave a comment, because there are so many anonymous people online, I am fraid they would steb me with their words. I usually just report the bullying situation.

In our community, most people like him and he is, in my opinion a neighbour anyone would expect to have.

## history person

Lu Xun was a Chinese writer.
Lu Xun studied medicine at Tohoku University in Japan. He hoped that after graduating and returning to China, he could treat patients like his father who were mistreated by traditional Chinese medicine, and also promote Chinese people's belief in the reform.
But later he realized that medicine was not an urgent matter. First priority was to change people's spirit, and to be good at changing their spirit at that time, of course, he had to promote literature and art. He decided to abandon medicine and pursue literature.
Latter, he wrote many excellent novels and essays. The themes of Lu Xun's novels are mostly anti-feudal, anti-traditional, and anti-superstition, reflecting the dark side of human nature. He is good at satire, and his writing is profound, and full of humor. I studied his articles when I was in high school, but I found them difficult to understand at the time. Only now that I have been working for two years and have a deeper understanding of this society have I begun to understand him. 
Sometimes I can't help but wonder what would happen if Lu Xun was still alive today. Because today traditional Chinese Medicine is still popular. There are countless cases of kidney failure caused by the abuse of traditional Chinese medicine. would he criticize this superstition on social media? If he does it, will he suffer cyberbullying, or will his social account be directly banned?
Lu Xun is one of the best modern writers in China. His articles have awakened the conscience of many people. This has a huge impact on the development of modern Chinese history.

##  a museum

I have visited many museums in the past few years, because when I travels to a new place I always like to pay a visit to the local museum. Because I believe this place can help me understand the local culture and history. But I think a lot of museums are very similar. They all display ancient paintings, ceramics, jewelry, and some contemporary political propaganda slogans. So today I would like to talk something different. The aircraft museum in the BeiHang university. I visited this museum when I was in high school, and I was very interested in aircraft at that age. Well acutally I am still very intrested in it but in a different way, I have watched all the documentaries "Air Crash Investigation".
This museunm displays the models of all kinds of planes from different countries. I took a lot of photos and learned a lot of relevant knowledge. There are some very unique airplanes out there, such as ones with asymmetrical wings and ones that look like a barrel. I must admit that I can no longer remember the specific names of those planes, but I can still recall the excitement at that time. 
This unique experience gave me the desire to study physics at Beihang University. It turned out that, I couldn't do it because my college entrance examination score was one point short. So I ended up studing information engineering in BUPT. It's ok, I am satisfied of my major and my life.
Well back to this topic, this aircraft museum is very special for me, not only because it has so many intersting planes that opened my eyes, but it is also related to my childhood dream.

## tourist

This national day I have 8 days off, 3 days from national day, 1 day from mid-autumn festival 2 days from weekend, and 2 days from vacation adjustment. This means that I have to work 7 days continuously. It sounds ridiculous, but it is Chinese holiday policy, I bet most people don't like it.
However,  during this vacation I went to XinJiang province with my girlfriend. She was in HangZhou province, and we hadn't met for 3 months. She flew to BeiJing and then we flew to Urumchi together. We rented a car and started our trip. 
It took us around forty minutes to get luggage from the carousel. It was three in the morning when we arrived at the hotel. I was exhausted however after a couple hours rest I drove 500 kilometers to Bruzin through a desert highway. It was the first time I drove in such a wide-open place. I was completely relaxed.
During this trip, we were mostly on the way. I mean, we drove about two thousand and six hundred kilometers in eight days. And that was exactly the most interesting part, because it's known to all that in XinJiang the most beautiful scenery is on the road. I have seen deserts,meadows, and snowy  mountains these days. 
The most memorable part of my journey was on the mountain road named DuKu. It wasn't the first time I drove on a winding road, actually my first time was just two days before that day, but It certainly was the the most challenging. It was desperately long and due to my misjudging of its difficulty, We were still on the mountain when the sky darkened. It was so silent and lonely without other cars, luckily I got my girlfriend as company so it was not that horrible. Anyway, the landscape during the trip was definitely worth seeing. It was my first time being so close to a snowy mountain. I mean, I actually stood on it, I was so excited,the beautiful scenery here exceeded my expectations when I was preparing this trip.
Besides the landscape, the control in XinJiang also surprised me quite a lot. Every car that went to Urumchi was pulled over by the police to check everyone's identity card. There were also many checkpoints at the highway entrance where I had to lower the windows and be scanned by surveillance cameras. The same procedure was required when I entered the gas station. And every hotel I lived these days had a security check with an x-ray machine, What's more astonishing? It seemed that every knife had a QR code on it.

## smoked fish

I like eating fish, and I enjoy cooking. I always cook meals for myself and for my sister if she pays a visit at the weekend. But I am not good at cooking fish, because I find it hard to fry fish. It always sticks to the pan easily and sometimes gets rotten, making it impossible to take it out as a whole.
But smoked fish doesn't have this disadvantage. ​Therefore, I use smoked fish instead of fresh ones. Smoked fish is easy to produce, after removing fish scales, gut the fish. Soak them in salt water for half an hour. The next step is to put the fish in a vat, burning charcoal to heat the fish for 30 minutes.
Smoked fish are easier to store, especially when you don't have a refrigerator. They have a special flavor, and most importantly for me, I will not stick to my pan easily.
I know exactly how to make smoked fish, but I can do it because I live in an apartment. In such a big city, it's not easy to find a place to make smoked fish. Usually I can only buy them from supermarkets. But these bought fish taste not as good as the ones that were made by my family. So sometimes I will ask my parents to send me some. ​Actually, right now, I have some smoked fish made by them in my refrigerator.

## wild animal

I wanted to keep a cat as a pet. But I changed my mind the first time I saw a red panda at Beijing Wildlife Park. They have dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs, white-lined ears, and a ringed tail. They are the cutest creatures I have ever seen. I fell in love with them just with one glimpse. Some people always mistake red pandas for raccoons. They share many similarities, such as similar patterns on their faces and a love of cleanliness. But raccoons are black and white and far less cute than red pandas.
In China, red pandas mainly live on the southern slopes of the Himalayas. They eat bamboo and various wild fruits. Sometimes they eat birds, too. 
I wish I could keep a red panda as a pet, because they are so cute and they have a gentel personality. Their fur feels a little hard, but warm. But sadly, red pandas are protected animals, which means it is illegal to keep one as a pet. But now the technology for breeding red pandas has been gradually developed, and there are now more than 160 red pandas at the Chengdu base. I hope one day their numbers are high enough that they are no longer considered endangered.

## performance

I have never attended any music festivals, or any concert, not because I don't like music, I just don't like crowded and noisy places. The interesting thing is that my younger sister is the opposite of me. She loves concerts and she is a big fan of a Chinese singer. 
Because I am good at cooking and we leave really close. One weekend she came to my house for lunch as usual. On her recommendation, we watched the video of Les Miserables 25th Anniversary Concert. This concert is an adaptation from the novel of the same name written by Victor Hugo. It tells the story of a man named Jean Valjean who constantly struggled with various persecutions in order to survive. The tense storyline and perfect singing made me feel like I was actually in 19th-century Paris. Among all the songs, I like one called "Do you hear the people singing" most. It is such a powerful song that saturated with the courage and passion of the people in revolution. It is the music of people who will not be slaves again.
I love this song so much, but dramatically, I get no result searching for this song on any music app. It is obvious that this song is banned by the government, because it was usually used for protests. I am not going to discuss whether banning this song is reasonable or not. But this undoubtedly shows how touching this song is.

## environment

Ten years before, more than half of the year is shrouded in smog. According to a research more than 500,000 deathes are related to the awful air condition every year. 
Sadly I don't think there are many things we ordinary people can do. I ride bike for cmmuting. I never let the light or air conditioner on when I am not at home to save energy. I believe I have done the best, but I also believe this is not helpful. Because 60% this air pollution are comming from combustion of coal and oil. Burning low-quality unwashed brown coal can cause serious air pollution.
Most cars are not environmentally compliant, but it was not until 2018 that the environmental protection department punished these companies for the first time. This kind of illegal behavior must be strictly punished, otherwise it will be equivalent to forcing them to pollute the environment. There is a simple mechanism of economics. No company will comply with the law without supervision, because that will increase their costs and put them at a disadvantage in market competition. So the environmental protection department needs to be responsible for this.
Although air quality has improved in recent years, I am still very dissatisfied. I have been suffering from allergic rhinitis and the bad air often keeps me at home on weekends. Maybe I will leave this city and live in a small village in the future. Or simply leave the country.
